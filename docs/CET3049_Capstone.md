Background

For this final practicum, trainees will undertake the developing of a web application of their own

choice. This practicum shall be delivered in 4 milestones as detailed in the Milestones section

below. Milestones should be seen as an "early draft" of the final implementation and will serve as

a "checkpoint" to evaluate the practicum, the general methodology to be employed and work that

has been accomplished so far.

Trainees are free to choose and create any kind of web application which they are interested but

shall adhere to the following requirements:

1. Front-end to be done using React JS.

2. Backend to be done using Spring / Spring boot (Java). RESTful web service.

3. A database with at least 3 tables is to be constructed from scratch. Access to the database

are through 3rd party libraries such as Spring Data (JDBC or JPA). At least 3 standard CRUD

operations must be implemented in your application. All 3 CRUD operations cannot be the

same. Using of sample databases from any source is not allowed.

For example, 3 standard CRUD operations can consist of 2  SELECT s, 1  UPDATE  or 1  SELECT ,

1  INSERT , 1  UPDATE . Any combination of CRUD operations except 3  SELECT s, 3  INSERT s, 3

UPDATE s or 3  DELETE s

4. Proper OOP concepts must be applied.

5. Your program has to be divided into several parts stored in different folders, each with an

appropriate name to describe their contents.

6. Prevent potential SQL injections.

7. Comments are required to justify your way of implementation.

8. Include a  ReadMe  text file with the Start up procedures of both your frontend and backend

applications. The priority is for your applications to run locally.

9. You are not allowed to choose projects that are similar in functionality or topic to any

applications used in the lectures. Past personal projects are also not allowed.

Milestones

Milestone 1 Deliverables (deadline: 17th Oct)

Trainees shall come up with a proposal (pdf document, max 5 pages) regarding the web

application which they intend to build. The proposal shall be as descriptive and detailed as

possible.

Include a wireframe of the website.

Submit Use cases and Activity diagrams describing the whole process from front-end

through to the backend functionalities.

Milestone 2 Deliverables (deadline: 7th Nov)

Backend implementation shall be done using Spring. Submit Class diagrams of the

functionalities.

MariaDB is used to store your database. Submit your ER diagram.

No raw SQL statements are allowed. Trainees are to use either Spring Data or JPA for

interfacing with the database.

Backend shall be implemented as a RESTful web service. All responses are to be returned as

JSON strings.

If you have changes to the documents from the previous milestones, submit them as well

with clear justification of your changes.

Milestone 3 Deliverables (deadline: 18th Dec)

Submission of the implementation (source code and all accompanying resources)

If you have changes to the documents from the previous milestones, submit them as well

with clear justification of your changes.

Code changes are still allowed after the submission of this Milestone.

Milestone 4 Deliverables (deadline: 19th Dec to 23 Dec)

Individual presentation of your web application

Each presentation shall be approximately 15 mins long, including a Q & A session.

Important notes

Time management is very important for this practicum. You will need time to experiment and

learn how to implement your web application from the design phase to the test phase.

Make sure you test thoroughly before submission of your codes.
